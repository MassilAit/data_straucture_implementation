# Implementing data structures
In order to review the principal data structures and their associated algorithms, I decided to reimplement them in Java. Furthermore, it allows me to refamiliarize myself with the Java language.

## Graphs

I've implemented generic graphs using an adjacency list. An adjacency list uses less memory than an adjacency matrix, even though it's more complex to implement. I also implemented the BFS and DFS algorithms, two graph traversal algorithms.
